- 👋 Hi, Alex, I'm a PHP, Ruby, and NodeJS fullstack web developer.
For years, coding has been a real passion for me, that's why I always put hard work and dedication to my projects. I have a very well organized way of working and I make sure my code is always as stable, well designed and future-proof as possible.

- 🌱 I never stop learning things. Web development is going very fast and we, developers, have to adapt quickly. But don't get me wrong ! I don't learn things just because they are in the trends. I try to optimize my work as much as possible so I can deliver quality projects, in time. I’m currently learning NodeJS and MongoDB because these technologies are very interesting, and I love the "all JavaScript" approach of NodeJS.

- 💞️ I’m looking for an opportunity in a company ! Remotely or in office. I live in Fribourg but I can move easily. You can contact me by email or by linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-da-costa-monteiro-1751a613a/


- 🚀My main project right now is Switiz :
http://switiz.ch

(Only in French for now)
It is a website where you can leave a review and a note of the quality of life of the city you live in. The cities are ranked by their notes and you can see all the others reviews.
It has been done in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and SASS. I was the only one on the project, so I also do the webmastering, updates and maintenance.
